Hey everyone! This is your guy Tunji aka Data Panda sharing with you all today my latest Go project. In this project I used both html and Go to build a basic local server but mainly usimg GO. 
I really enjoyed this project because it introduced me to a lot of new functions and packages like the "log" and "net/http" and the formHandler func.
The path for the server uses "/", "/hello", "/form", "/form.html". Please let me know if any of the paths don't work or fork it! Always looking to collab.
